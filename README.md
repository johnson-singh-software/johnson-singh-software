- 3D space where the user can push objects around. Force is applied to the objects in the scene using the onClick point on the object and the normal of this raycast hit to calculate the direction the object needs to be pushed.
- Versatile system, it pushes on mesh faces so it works with any 3D models
- Uses React Three Cannon physics engine.
