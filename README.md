### Personal Site (Front End)

![Live](johnson-singh.netlify.app), ![Repository](https://github.com/bM7tcHF88GBxDni/react-three-fiber-cannon-drei-007)

ThreeJS, React

- Used ThreeJS and React to create a 3D world where the camera smoothly animations between different locations, from scratch
- App designed so React components physically exist in the 3D world, and otherwise act as normal DOM elements used for user interaction

### 3D Sandbox, play it! (Front End)

![Live](https://center-impulse.netlify.app), ![Repository](https://github.com/bM7tcHF88GBxDni/react-three-fiber-cannon-drei-005)

ThreeJS, React

- 3D space where the user can push objects around. Force is applied to the objects in the scene using the onClick point on the object and the normal of this raycast hit to calculate the direction the object needs to be pushed.
- Versatile system, it pushes on mesh faces so it works with any 3D models
- Uses React Three Cannon physics engine.
